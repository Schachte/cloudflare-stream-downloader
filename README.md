In case you wish to download an embedded video on a different site and you don't have the access to the Cloudflare Dash, get to the frame's source code, find the poster url in the following format `https://customer-<CODE>.cloudflarestream.com/<UID>/thumbnails/thumbnail.jpg` and replace `thumbnail/thumbnanil.jpg` with `manifest/video.m3u8`. Example URL: `https://customer-f33zs165nr7gyfy4.cloudflarestream.com/6b9e68b07dfee8cc2d116e4c51d6a957/manifest/video.m3u8`
